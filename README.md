## Introduction
  We present a novel interactive augmented reality (AR) storytelling approach guided by indoor scene semantics. Our approach automatically populates virtual contents in real-world environments to deliver AR stories, which match both the story plots and scene semantics. During the storytelling process, a player can participate as a character in the story. Meanwhile, the behaviors of the virtual characters and the placement of the virtual items adapt to the player's actions.
